# SproutApp

# 🌱 SproutApp

SproutApp is a cozy Java-based CLI tool designed to quickly scaffold project templates for developers. With a few simple flags, you can generate structured folders, starter files, and even auto-initialize a Git repository with optional GitHub integration — perfect for students and devs who want to skip the setup and jump straight into coding.

Created with 🌿 by Alexandria (MintBanshee) as part of a Java assignment at triOS College.
